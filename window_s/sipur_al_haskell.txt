You just bound a variable. That is, you bound x to the expression 4, and then you can write x in some code (the body) and it will mean the same as if you'd written 4.

It's like this: let var = expression in body
The in part just separates the expression from the body.

For example try: let x = 8 * 10 in x + x

So if we wanted to get the age of our villain, we could do:
let villain = (28,"chirs") in fst villain
